How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It made the tedious manual process of looking up errors much more easier and faster.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It saves a lot of time when debugging.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

It helps to create relevant checkpoint. Since relavant is subjective to each individual, 
it lets you choose when you want to which if delayed too long can be a problem.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is for programmers basically for whom version control for a group of files is essential
unlike Google docs which is for general public especially for non programmers.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log lets you see the entire history of the file ad git diff lets you compare between
two commits to find out the changes made from one commit to the next.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

 Have the entire history of working parts of the code. Easy to trace back rather than 
 start from scratch.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 Version control
